# checkminer
Python script to check the Claymore Miner hashrate (CryptoNote)

Install Python3 (the embeddable zip one will be fine): https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Edit the config in the script "checkminer.py" to your needs (miner IP:port, minimum hash rate, file to execute)
Launch the script and let it run: python checkminer.py

I provided a batch file example to reboot the whole rig if the hash rate is too low. Use the full path to the file.

The script is designed to check the hash rate of Claymore CryptoNote 11.3 but it can be easily twaked to work with any miner that provides a web interface

If you're rich enough will apprecciate any donation :)
